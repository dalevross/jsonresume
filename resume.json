I can thoroughly recommend Dale as someone who anticipates others’ needs before they are aware of them, and solves problems promptly and with a (virtual) smile."

Often times, I had no real requirements for him but a vision and he was able to deliver each time. His development skills span client side and server side components and he is a great Microsoft technologist. We worked on innovative solutions including a mobile-first asp.net MVC project utilizing the Telerik Kendo Framework. We also worked on creating a custom Single Sign On (SSO) solution which we implemented on an already built custom application. I appreciated his cool and calm demeanor which I found helpful when dealing with complex solutions."
